 * @description Centralized service for tracking user events.
 * 
 * This service provides a single point for all event tracking calls within the application.
 * Currently, it logs events to the browser's console, which is useful for development
 * and debugging. It is designed to be easily adaptable to a real analytics provider
 * like Google Analytics (GA4), Amplitude, Mixpanel, etc.

/**
 * Tracks a user event.
 * 
 * To upgrade to a real analytics provider, you would modify this function.
 * For example, with Google Analytics 4 (gtag.js), it would look like this:
 * 
 * declare global {
 *   interface Window {
 *     gtag: (...args: any[]) => void;
 *   }
 * }
 * 
 * export const trackEvent = (eventName: string, eventData: Record<string, any>): void => {
 *   console.log('[ANALYTICS]', eventName, eventData); // Good to keep for debugging
 *   if (typeof window.gtag === 'function') {
 *     window.gtag('event', eventName, eventData);
 *   }
 * };
 * 
 * @param eventName A string that identifies the event (e.g., 'recommendation_search', 'tab_view').
 * @param eventData An object containing additional data about the event.

// Simple analytics tracking function
export const trackEvent = (eventName: string, properties: Record<string, any> = {}) => {
  // In development, just log the events
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    console.log('ðŸ“Š Analytics Event:', eventName, properties);

  // In production, you can integrate with your preferred analytics service
  // For example: Google Analytics, Mixpanel, etc.
  // Example for Google Analytics 4:
  // if (typeof gtag !== 'undefined') {
  //   gtag('event', eventName, properties);
  // }
